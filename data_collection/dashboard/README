Linux client:
-------------
Dashboard linux client fetches all information about ros nodes in data collection ref kit and publishes it to web client for diagnostics.

*Steps to run*
  - Check whether mosquitto broker is running or not. ( systemctl status mosquitto.service)
  - If required add the user name and password for client authentication in MQTT broker. (Should update in the code too).
  - roslaunch linux_dashboard dboard.launch
  - The process waits for connection with the web client.
  - If the dashboard is running on two different hardware boards (connected through ethernet), 
    Make sure to change the node name, because ROS 	does not support running two nodes with same name.

Web client: 
----------- 
Dashboard web client is used for Diagnostics of driving data collection ref kit. It displays information such as,
  - List of nodes running, Its internal topics and publishing rates.
	- Details of the SSD connected and its memory percentage.
	- Whether the nodes are running as expected or not.
  
*Steps to run*
  - Please open index.html (.web/mqttjs_utilty/index.html) in any browser for web application.
  - Connect with the broker by giving all the details required.
  - This will automatically start communication with the linux dashboard clients..
